# Project ChaTPSIT
This has been an experimental school project developed by me and some other students of my class.  
It consists of a client/server chat architecture based on TCP sockets, split in 3 programs:
- a **server** that forwards messages, with a CLI where you can see the log in real time
- a **client** GUI where you can log in and then send messages in a global chat or write PMs to other connected users
- an **admin panel** GUI which allows admins to check server log remotely, ban users and monitor the global chat

Java 8 is required to run them (Linux users must download OpenJFX package too). IntelliJ IDEA is recommended if you want to build the code on your own (configuration files are included in the repo).  
The code is partly documented in Italian, check it out if you need some inspiration for similar projects. I must say that the overall server architecture is vastly improvable, though.  
Expect bugs and minor issues!
